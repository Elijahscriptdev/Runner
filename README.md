# Video Game: Fitaita

![Runner]()

Runner is an RPG video game built with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io), an open source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered games. This game was inspired by [Phaser 3 tutorial: Endless Runner](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1). The main objective was to create a custom role play game.

Assignment [link](https://www.notion.so/Platform-game-4a55a7d1fcc245bcb012c76814764712).

## Overview
Runner is a single player based game. The game is intended to determine how fast a player can collect enough stars. The game has infinite levels and the player is  expected to collect 6000 stars to escape.

## Gameplay
###### Player
Player (Runner) uses the direction keys( up: to jump and move to upper blocks, down: to move down in a faster way, left: to move left, right: to move right). He continues on in quest to collect stars

###### Enemy
Bombs are released from vertically into game. They will continue bounce.


## Design and Thinking
In the first day I read alot on the Phaserjs library and I got started with the documentation from the [official docs](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/). It took me a couple of days understanding the concepts.
On the fifth day, I came up with my game mechanics, including the game name, players, enemy and scoring system. The day after, I starting coding based on my own plan.

## Assets
All sprites, images and sounds used in this game are from [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org).
